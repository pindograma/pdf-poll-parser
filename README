Welcome to pdf-poll-parser!

This is a series of Python scripts that use pdfminer to extract polling data
from PDFs published by Brazilian pollsters. They generally follow patterns
that allow for this process.

Currently supported pollsters are:
- Ibope (2012, 2014, 2016, 2018)
- Escutec (2012, 2016) *

Pollster PDFs were obtained from the following sources:
- Ibope: http://eleicoes.ibopeinteligencia.com/
- Escutec: http://www.escutec.com/

*: Parser fails on 5% or less of the PDF set. These outliers will require
manual parsing.
